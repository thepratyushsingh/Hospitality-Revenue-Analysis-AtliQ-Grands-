# Hospitality-Revenue-Analysis-AtliQ-Grands-
Problem Statement:

AtliQ Grands owns multiple 5-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from the competitors and ineffective decision making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Date intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However they don't have in-house data analytics to provide them with these insights.

So after learning about the key metrics, i created them to perform analytics. 

After analysing the visuals we derived the following insights:
1. Weekend/ Weekday pricing strategy: The occupancy on weekends and weekdays were relatively same, indicating that they were using same pricing in both of the cases. They can increase their prices on weekends to increase their revenue.
2. Dynamic pricing strategy: It should increase its prices on holidays to see a surge in revenue.
3. Revenue through different channels: It is observed that booking from different channels(booking platform) are relatively same. So AtliQ Grands has opportunity to give discounts on its own channel(website) to increase its revenue.
